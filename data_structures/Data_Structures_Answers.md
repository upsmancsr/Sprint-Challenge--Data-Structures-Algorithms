Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
The time complexity should by O(n).

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
O(bd) where b is branching factor and d is depth


3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
N/A

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
N/A

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
It should be something like O(c*n) where c is some constant. for each n there is a loop to insert it in the heap, a loop to bubble up, and a loop to insert it into the sorted list.

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
